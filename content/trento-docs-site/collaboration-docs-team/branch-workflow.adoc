= Git branch workflow: Managing a single repository with multiple branches

== Summary

This guide describes the workflow for maintaining synchronized documentation branches in a single repository.
The Development team and the Documentation team collaborate using this workflow to ensure documentation consistency across versions.

== Repository structure

The documentation repository contains:

`main` branch::
  Contains the latest development documentation for the open source project.
  Uses `version: ~` and `display_version: latest` in the `antora.yml` file.

`suse` branch::
  Contains the official release documentation for SUSE.
  Uses `version: suse` and `display_version: 2.5` in the `antora.yml` file.

The suse branch will always represent the latest released versionand reflects the released version at link:https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/trento/html/SLES-SAP-trento/index.html[documentation.suse.com]

== Weekly synchronization procedure

Synchronize the branches at least weekly during or after the Documentation team sync call.
This procedure ensures all improvements from `main` are included in the release suse branch.

=== Synchronization steps

.Procedure: Synchronizing release branch with main
. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git fetch origin
----

. Switch to the release branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout suse
----

. Start the rebase operation:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git rebase main
----
+

. Resolve changes
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git rebase --continue
----

. Push the updated branch to the remote repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git push --force-with-lease
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Always use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` to prevent accidental overwrites of others' work.
====

== Verification

After synchronization, verify the changes:

.Procedure: Verifying synchronization results
. Check which files differ between branches:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git diff main
----

== Guidelines for team members

=== Development team responsibilities

* Commit all new features and fixes to `main` first
* Perform regular synchronization after sync calls
* Communicate before force-pushing to suse branch

== Troubleshooting

[qanda]
Why do we always get a conflict with antora.yml?::
  The `main` branch uses `version: ~` while the release branch uses `version: suse`.
  This difference is intentional and the conflict is expected.

What if someone else pushed to the release branch?::
  Coordinate with them first.
  Pull their changes before rebasing:
  `git pull origin suse`

How can I preview changes before pushing?::
  Create a draft pull request from your local branch to review changes before force-pushing.
